This project is a live Indian stock price tracker built using Python. It fetches the current stock price of any NSE-listed company (such as TCS.NS, RELIANCE.NS, INFY.NS, HDFCBANK.NS) using the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance) and stores the output in an Excel file for tracking and analysis.

The script automatically updates the price every 5 seconds and logs.
