# Indian-Stock-Price-Live-Tracker.py
This project is a live Indian stock price tracker built using Python. It fetches the current stock price of any NSE-listed company (such as TCS.NS, RELIANCE.NS, INFY.NS, HDFCBANK.NS) using the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance) and stores the output in an Excel file for tracking and analysis.
